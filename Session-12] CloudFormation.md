# CloudFormation -
- AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you automate the provisioning and management of AWS resources using infrastructure as code (IaC).
- You define your infrastructure in a YAML or JSON template, and CloudFormation creates and manages those resources for you.
## Components -
- Template – A YAML/JSON file that defines your AWS resources.
- Stack – A collection of AWS resources defined in a template.
- Change Set – A preview of changes before applying them to a stack.
- Drift Detection – Detects changes made outside CloudFormation.

# Basic Steps to Use CloudFormation:
- Create a Template – Define resources like EC2, S3, RDS, etc.
- Upload the Template – Use the AWS Console, CLI, or SDK.
- Deploy the Stack – CloudFormation provisions resources.
- Update the Stack – Modify and apply changes safely.
- Delete the Stack – Remove all resources automatically.
